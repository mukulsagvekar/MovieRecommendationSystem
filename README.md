# Movie Recommendation System

Movie Recommendation System based on Collaborative Filtering recommends movies based on the reviews giving by different users. Used KNN algorithm and cosine similarity.

## Colaborative Filtering:

Colaborative filtering operates under the assumption that similar users will have similar likes. It uses rating information from all other users to provide predictions for a user-item interaction and, thereby, whittles down the item choices for the users, from the complete item set.

## KNN algorithm
Using KNN neighbour, here we take 5 closest neighbours(i.e. closest movies). We are using cosine similarity as a measure.
